    <h1>Participate in translation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the first version English translation provided by <a href="https://github.com/emircanerkul">Emircan ERKUL</a>.</p>
<p>Due to limited energy, most translations currently use machine translation, so accuracy is inevitably problematic.</p>
<p>At present, the 【Course】 section is not translated. If you are interested, please join us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to participate in the translation of this document, you can clone this repository first.</p>
<p>The translated documents are in the <code>/web/src/pages/Doc/</code> directory, and currently support English(<code>en</code>) and Simplified Chinese(<code>zh</code>).</p>
<p>If you are adding a new language type, you can create a new directory under the <code>/web/src/pages/Doc/</code> directory, Then create a folder for each chapter, You can also directly copy all chapter directories under the existing language directory for translation, Note that you only need to write the <code>index.md</code> file, The <code>index.vue</code> file under the chapter directory is automatically generated by the script according to <code>index.md</code>.</p>
<p>If you are adding a translation chapter to an existing language type, You can create a new chapter directory under the target language directory, You only need to create a <code>index.md</code> file under the directory.</p>
<p>After you complete the translation, you can directly submit <code>Pull requests</code>.</p>
<p>If you are a front-end programmer and want to run the service, check the effect of the document page, If a new chapter is added, the file <code>/web/src/pages/Doc/catalogList.js</code> needs to be modified, Select the appropriate location in the <code>StartList</code> or <code>APIList</code> array to insert the <code>path</code> of the new chapter. Then you need to run <code>npm run buildDoc</code> under the <code>web</code> directory to compile the directory and route. Finally, run <code>npm run serve</code> starts the local service. Open the following path to view the document:</p>
<p><code>ip:port/#/doc/zh/introduction</code></p>
