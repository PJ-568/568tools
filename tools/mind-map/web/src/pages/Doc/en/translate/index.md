If you want to participate in the translation of this document, you can clone this repository first.

The translated documents are in the `/web/src/pages/Doc/` directory, and currently support English(`en`) and Simplified Chinese(`zh`).

If you are adding a new language type, you can create a new directory under the `/web/src/pages/Doc/` directory, Then create a folder for each chapter, You can also directly copy all chapter directories under the existing language directory for translation, Note that you only need to write the `index.md` file, The `index.vue` file under the chapter directory is automatically generated by the script according to `index.md`.

If you are adding a translation chapter to an existing language type, You can create a new chapter directory under the target language directory, You only need to create a `index.md` file under the directory.

After you complete the translation, you can directly submit `Pull requests`.

If you are a front-end programmer and want to run the service, check the effect of the document page, If a new chapter is added, the file `/web/src/pages/Doc/catalogList.js` needs to be modified, Select the appropriate location in the `StartList` or `APIList` array to insert the `path` of the new chapter. Then you need to run `npm run buildDoc` under the `web` directory to compile the directory and route. Finally, run `npm run serve` starts the local service. Open the following path to view the document:

`ip:port/#/doc/zh/introduction`
